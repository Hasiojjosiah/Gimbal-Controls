Gimbal-Controls
===============

Arduino code for 2-axis gimbal controls for our electronics project at Pomona College, spring 2014 semester. This code is very much in development, and we appreciate all advice and pointers for refinement. 

It is heavily based on sketches by Jeff Rowberg, found at https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib, and http://elabz.com/bldc-motor-with-arduino-circuit-and-software/.

We can be reached at andreas.biekert@pomona.edu with any questions or concerns (we'll do our best to help out!)
